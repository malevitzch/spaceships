# spaceships
A simple game written in C++ using the SFML-3.0 library that I always wanted to make. Or at least make something similar. 
# todo
- Template a "normalizer" which attempts to make a value reach 0 by picking one of two options (calling the corresponding method)
- Finish implementing OmniCore by adding speed stabilization (with A + D the ship cancels out lateral movement and with W + S cancels main movement)
- Do not translate symbolic units to screen pixels directly, rather implement a game camera
- Separate game logic from window creation, add a menu for selecting ships (useful for testing too)
- Viable graphics
