# spaceships
A simple game written in C++ using the SFML-3.0 library that I always wanted to make. Or at least make something similar. 
# todo
- Viable graphics
- Do not translate symbolic units to screen pixels directly, rather implement a game camera
- Move away from the SFML coordinate system if possible cause it makes some math pretty cursed
- Separate game logic from window creation, add a menu for selecting ships (useful for testing too)
- Add universal headers that include a bunch of stuff
